<!-- 
	this will be the html for the furry dating sim style message block
	Its mainly to convert boring old text into something more fun and ~interactive~

	The entire message block will be laid out in two chunks stacked on top of each other

	The top chunk will be the FurryHead
		FurryHead will have a fixed height of 80px, and will stretch the full width of the browser window
		FurryHead will have a cool gradient background with a border
		- the top chunk will have:
			- the character's profile picture, aligned to the left
				- The profile picture will be a slightly rounded square, with a colorized, stylized border
				- The profile picture will have a fixed size of 75px by 75px
			- a button panel, aligned to the center of the remaining space
				- The button panel will have:
					- the character's name at the top
					- a grid of four buttons
						- top left: "Profile"
						- top right: "DM"
						- bottom left: "Flirt"
						- bottom right: "Yiff"
			The profile picture and button panel will be next to each other, on the same line
				This will be done with a flexbox
			The button panel must fit within the FurryHead, both vertically and horizontally
	
	The bottom chunk will be the FurryBody
		FurryBody will have a fixed height of 200px, and will stretch the full width of the browser window
		FurryBody will have a cool gradient background with a border
		- the bottom chunk will have:
			- The name and action line
				- It'll look something like: "Foxxxy Vixen asks,"
					- Foxxxy Vixen will be the character's name, and will be bolded
					- "asks," will be the action line, and will be italicized
				- It'll be at the top of the chunk, aligned to the left
			- The message text
				- Will wrap if it's too long
				- Will be aligned to the left
				- Will have some padding on the left and right
	
	All blocks will have as little padding and margin as possible, with a goal of compactness
		This is because the browser window is actually narrow and tall, and we want to fit as much as possible on the screen
	Everything will be contained in a parent div that defines the width, and holds everything in place
	All styling will be done inlined, because the system that will use this doesn't support external stylesheets
