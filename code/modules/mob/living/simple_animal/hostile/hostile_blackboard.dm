/// This is all working memory, things that the mob wants to remember for more than a single proc
/// This is *not* used to define how the mob acts, those vars are stored on the mob (annoyingly enough)
/// If its a behavior, it should be on the mob
/// If its the result of a behavior, or something that could influence another behavior, it should be here
/// Short term memory is for things that are relevant for the split instance that is a turn's worth of decisions
/// Used mostly for precaching checks that would be inconvenient to pass through multiple procs
/// Things like "can I see the target" or "am I next to the target"
/// Midterm memory is for things that are relevant for the duration of a single complete action
/// Things actions that take more than a split instant to complete, like attacking or moving
/// Longterm memory is for things that are relevant for multiple actions, possibly even indefinitely
/// Things like a target's last known position, whether or not we've seen this target before, etc
/// Try not to store any hard references to things in longterm memory, as they'll surely cause hard dels
/// Coordinates, strings, and other primitives are good, weak references might be okay, but be careful
