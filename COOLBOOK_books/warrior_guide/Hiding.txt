%TITLE:Hiding

Do not share this with outsiders, but remember that you can shift yourself just right to get behind the foliage of trees without become obvious.  Lay to the ground
and wait in these positions and failing dark magics most of the outlanders will simply never see you.  Just remember to stay quiet and don't move any more than you have to.

Also don't forget to turn your lights down if you can, though.  Lets be real.  A torch is a distraction most of the time.
