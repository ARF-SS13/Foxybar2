These files are a digital museum, if you dare to dust them off in some form then be aware you will be spending time in the code form of the maps, mass replacing old code.

These files are ancient.  
Many of them from versions of byond so far gone that even your grandmothers crusty dust caked nethers wouldn't recognize the madness within.  
Use them with extreme caution, preferably as just guidelines for re-making something new.
If you use shit out of them raw I'm going to raw dog your sister and put the blame on you for when she gets pregnant.


You have been warned.
